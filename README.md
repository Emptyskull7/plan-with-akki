# Plan With Akki

Plan With Akki is a React-based web application that allows users to explore and manage a curated list of travel destinations across India. Users can read more about each destination, remove destinations they are not interested in, and refresh the list to start over.

## Features

- **View Destinations:** Browse a list of beautiful travel destinations, each with an image, name, price, and description.
- **Read More / Show Less:** Expand or collapse the description for each destination to read more details.
- **Remove Destinations:** Remove destinations you are not interested in from the list.
- **Refresh List:** If all destinations are removed, easily refresh the list to restore all destinations.
